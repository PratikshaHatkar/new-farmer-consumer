Nice work 👏
Yes — **authentication is DONE** and your dashboard UI already looks solid.
Now you should move from **“who is the user?”** ➜ **“what can the user do?”**

Below is the **correct next-feature roadmap**, in the **right order**, especially for a **Farmer Marketplace app** like yours.

---

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS (You’re here)

✔ Login / Register
✔ JWT auth
✔ Role = farmer
✔ Dashboard UI
✔ Username displayed

👉 Now build **real functionality** behind the UI.
